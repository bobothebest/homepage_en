<h2 style="font-family: 华文楷体;">Experience</h2>

<p style="text-align:left;font-family: 华文楷体;"><b>Rating prediction of domestic TV series based on sentiment analysis<span style="float:right;">2022.02-2022.04</span></b></p>
 <p style="font-family: 华文楷体;">By crawler, 5,505 pieces of basic information of domestic TV plays in Douban were crawled. For the TV play "Beginning", which is highly discussed in the beginning of 2022, 160,000 pieces of short commentary information were crawled. After word segmentation, word stop processing and text vectoring, the sentiment polarity analysis of the commentary text was carried out by using naive Bayes, LSTM and SVM respectively. After comparison, SnowNLP was used to generate the emotional score of each comment, and the mean emotional score was calculated as the emotional score variable of this TV series. By analyzing the data set of short reviews of "Beginning", the average emotion score of 500 comments can represent the average emotion score of the whole movie and TV series, with a relative error of no more than 0.01. For the text information in the basic information of the original TV series, the classification variable is numerically calculated by calculating the average score of the TV series that participated in the category in the past. One hundred TV shows were randomly selected, and each TV show climbed the latest 500 comments and calculated the average emotional score. Multiple linear regression and regression tree were used to model the processed data sets. It is found that introducing emotion score and increasing the amount of data contained in the data set can significantly increase the goodness of fit of the model on the test set. Through model fitting, the factors that have a great influence on the quality of TV series are found. Compared with the model, it is found that for small sample data sets, regression tree has a better goodness of fit in the test set. Based on the model results and exploratory analysis, some suggestions are put forward for the production and development of Chinese TV dramas. </p>


<p style="text-align:left;font-family: 华文楷体;"><b>Shanghai Challenge Cup Business plan <span style="float:right;">2019.12-2021.05</span></b></p>
 <p style="font-family: 华文楷体;">Participated in and wrote the report "Research on the Current Situation of Media literacy and Financial Literacy of College Students and Cultivation Strategies under the background of" Campus Loan ". I was mainly responsible for crawler, data collection and data cleaning in the group. Through questionnaires and the crawling and analysis of KOL speeches on Weibo and B platform, the project proves that there is a strong positive correlation between media literacy and financial literacy of college students. </p>
